# Discrete_Processor_Simulator
 A console application that simulates processor throughput and average wait times based on 3 user defined values.

'M' -- an exponential distribution MEAN corresponding to inter-arrival times between jobs 
'T' -- an exponential distribution MEAN corresponding to individual execution times
'P' -- a numerical value determining number of processors in system

This is by no means a formal repository- just a way for me to track and showcase my project progress.
